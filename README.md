# ANN-vs-CNN-algorithm-
A comparative analysis was carried out between the Artificial Neural Network I(ANN) and Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in Image classification problem. The dataset is from Tensorflow and the result shows that the CNN performed better with higher accuracy compared to the ANN.
